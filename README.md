# cloudformation-template-s3-cloudfront-codepipeline
Cloudformation template for code pipeline with SPA React app and AWS resources: S3 and Cloudfront.

This isn't the complete solution as I was kind of putting things together. You may have issue with configuring Rout53, Cloudfront, and S3 but it will be simple to figure them out. Check `References` section.
